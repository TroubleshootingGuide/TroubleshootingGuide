# Description

Happy customers are core to success of a company. With digital age, customers have become very demanding! Customers want answers now, not tomorrow. They expect you attend to them at their every need, without delay. And the longer it takes to respond, the more likely it is that the customer will leave. According to research 70% of customers now prefer self-help to reduce time spent on the issue.  

In order for customer to solve the issue themselves they could be using knowledge, experience in the field and search for online solutions. However they end up not able to solve the issue and creating a support case after putting months of effort. 

As part of this project 'Svādhyāya' we are trying to curate self-help content from support engineer's knowledgebase. Most or all of the team has a set of things they do for each bucket of the problems and the idea here is to share these to customers so that they know exact steps to follow when a particular type of issue is faced for a Microsoft product. It is also possible they still need help from support for some issues however customers had curated self help for the scenario they face and the learnings could help CSS solve the issue faster.

Svādhyāya' potentially would help:

Product-specific curated self help content 
Self help troubleshooting transcript which can be saved at end. 
Cost of support / support bandwidth can be saved 
Faster closure of cases if customer does basic troubleshooting through Svādhyāya'
